# Simple To-Do List Web Application

Hello! üëã This is a basic and intuitive To-Do List web application built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to easily manage their tasks by adding, marking as complete, and deleting items from a list.

## Key Features Implemented

This To-Do List application offers the following functionalities:

* **Add New Tasks:** A simple input field allows users to type in and add new tasks to their list.
* **Display Tasks:** Existing tasks are displayed clearly in a list format.
* **Mark as Complete:** Users can mark tasks as completed, visually indicating their status (e.g., strikethrough, different styling).
* **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from their list.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes for usability on various devices.
* **Basic Styling:** A clean and user-friendly interface styled with CSS.
* **Client-Side Logic:** All the core functionality (adding, deleting, marking complete) is handled on the client-side using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

This project relies on the fundamental web development stack:

* **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the To-Do List application.
* **CSS:** Styles the visual appearance and layout of the application.
* **JavaScript:** Implements the interactive behavior, such as handling user input, updating the task list, and managing task states.

## How to Run Locally

To run this To-Do List application on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/nitishgithubrit/to-do-list.git
2. Open the project folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## What I Learned During Development

Building this To-Do List helped me solidify my understanding of:

* DOM manipulation using JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML content.
* Handling user events (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) with JavaScript.
* Applying CSS for styling and layout.
* Creating a basic interactive web application on the client-side.

## Potential Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future improvements to this To-Do List:

* **Local Storage Persistence:** Save the To-Do List data in the browser's local storage so it persists even after the browser is closed.
* **Task Editing:** Allow users to edit existing tasks.
* **Task Prioritization:** Implement a way to prioritize tasks.
* **Categorization/Tags:** Add the ability to categorize or tag tasks.
* **User Accounts (Backend Integration):** If expanded to a full-stack application, implement user accounts to store lists.
* **More Advanced Styling:** Enhance the visual design with more advanced CSS techniques.

## Contributing

As this is a personal project for learning, I'm not actively seeking contributions at the moment. However, feel free to fork the repository and experiment with the code.
I'm always interested in seeing how others might extend it!
